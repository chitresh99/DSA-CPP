## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of code examples and implementations related to various data structures and algorithms. .

## Usage

Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside each folder, you will find the C++ code along with comments explaining the logic and functionality of the implementation.

To use the code:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chitresh99/DSA-CPP.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder.
3. Compile and run the C++ files using a C++ compiler like `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o outputName
    ./outputName
    ```
