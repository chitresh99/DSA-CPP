First if Condition: if(a[i] > largest)
Purpose: To update the largest element when a new largest element is found.
Actions:
The previous largest element becomes the new slargest (second largest).
The current element a[i] becomes the new largest.
This condition ensures that every time we find a new largest element, we also keep track of the previous largest element, which becomes the new second largest.

Second else if Condition: else if(a[i] < largest && a[i] > slargest)
Purpose: To update the second largest element when the current element is not the largest but is greater than the current second largest.
Actions:
The current element a[i] becomes the new slargest.


else if(a[i] < largest && a[i] > slargest)
This checks if the current element a[i] is:
Smaller than the current largest (so it can't be the largest).
Larger than the current slargest (so it can be the second largest).
Purpose: Update the second largest element only if the current element is between the largest and the second largest.
