Learnings :- 

About the max header file :- we pass it in a loop of array to find the maximum number so how will it go it will compare two numbers at once right and discard the smallest number out of the two after that the largest number will be compared to the next number

When you use std::max in a loop to find the maximum number in an array, it compares two numbers at a time and keeps track of the largest number found so far.
