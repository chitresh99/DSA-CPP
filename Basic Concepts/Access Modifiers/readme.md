**Access Modifiers**

There are three types of access modifiers

1) Public
2) Private
3) Protected

By defualt the access modifier we have is private

Public accessifier :- The data members and functions can be accessed anywhere from the code like inside the class and outside the class

Private accessifier :- This can be accesssed only from inside the class

Protected class :- Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its subclasses (derived classes).


You can add data like numbers or any sort of string using dot operators like :-

`chitresh.height = 6;`
