** Classes and objects**

Classes :- Classes is like a blueprint/template 

Example :- Let's say you want to bake cookies the recipe which you will use to bake cookies will be call the blueprint/template which is the class

Objects :- This is self-explanatory 

Example :- The cookies which you will get from the recipe is called Objects 

We can also call these instance basically objects and the word instance can be used interchangeably 


if the class is empty you will still get one byte for the identification


**Including a cpp file**
